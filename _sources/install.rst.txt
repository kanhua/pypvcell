Installing Pypvcell
====================

Package requirements
--------------------------

- Pypvcell supports 3.x.
- Numpy, Scipy, pint, Matplotlib


If you are new to python
-------------------------

You can obtain a copy of python language along with the some scientific compuation packages by downloading it from Anaconda.https://www.continuum.io/downloads







Install Pypvcell via pip
-------------------------

We recommend a two step process:

First, download the repository with git clone::

    git clone https://github.com/kanhua/pypvcell.git

Switch to the downloaded Pypvcell directory, and install it via pip::

    pip install ./

If you would like to do some experimental changes of pypvcell, you can add parameter -e, i.e.,::

    pip install -e ./

In this way, instead of copying file to your python site-packages directory, pip creates a link to your downloaded pypvcell folder.
You can then directly play with the code in the pypvcell directory.


P.S.
We are planning to add this project to [the python package index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) after a more steady version of pypvcell is released.
This would make the installation through PIP a little bit easier in the future.



Package requirements
--------------------------

- Pypvcell support both Python 2.x and 3.x. However, we recommend using Python 3.
- Numpy, Scipy, pint, Matplotlib
