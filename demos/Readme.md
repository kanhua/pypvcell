# Pypvcell application examples


The best way to start using pypvcell is through examples.
This folder collects a number of examples of the capabilities of pypvcell.

- [Handling spectrum data with Spectrum class](./dealing_with_spectrum_data.ipynb)

Spectrum class is an important data structure in Pypvcell that does the heavy-lifting of
 arithmetic operations and unit conversions of spectrum data. See this ipynb file for more details.
 
- [Optimal band gap calculation](./efficiency_vs_bandgap.ipynb)

This example demonstrates how to calculate optimal band gaps of single and multi-junction solar cells by using pypvcell.
